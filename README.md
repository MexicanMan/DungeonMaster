# DungeonMaster
Simple time-killer game made in microservice architecture.

## Game description
The main goal of this game - collect as more treasures as you can until monsters put you to death! After then you will be able to start over with zero scores. Or if you want you can save your score forever in the leaderboard!

To make your experience more random and strange every door you open in the dungeon will randomly lead to new rooms or to the old ones probably have been discovered by other players or by yourself! So that your different dungeons will combine and connect.

## Main rules
* To pick up a treasure or to open the closed door you should kill monster first.
* But you always able to escape from a monster into the already opened door!
* Every time you attack a monster and it is not killed by your attack, it strikes you back!
* Damage always is 1HP.
* Every time you pick up a treasure it heals your wounds (or your wounded ego :))
* Once you die you won't be able to resurrect. The only way to keep playing with the old character is to wipe out all your previous history and treasures and start over with zero scores. So think twice!
